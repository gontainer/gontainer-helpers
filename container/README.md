# Container

This package provides a concurrently safe DI container. It supports **scoped variables**, and **atomic hot swapping**.
For bigger projects, it provides a tool for the code generation.

See [docs](docs).

```bash
go get -u github.com/gontainer/gontainer-helpers/v3/container@latest
```

## Examples

### HotSwap

```go
// TODO
```
